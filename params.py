                 Parameters defined in this file:
                 - continuous: determines whether model is continuous
                 - sim_path: filepath where results from simulation are written to
                 - mat_file: filepath to the matlab data file
                 - data_path: filepath to csv file containing data for model fitting
                 - outcomes: numpy array of trial outcomes
                 - n_outcomes: number of outcomes (also number of trials)
                 - n_subjects: number of subjects to be simulated
                 - fit_method: method to be used for model fitting
